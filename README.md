# ðŸ§¼ Clean Code in JavaScript

A practical presentation for frontend developers on writing cleaner, more maintainable JavaScript by control structures and error handling.

---

## ðŸ§  Control Structures

- **Guard Clauses** â€“ Return early for clarity
- **Extracting Conditions into Functions** â€“ Make logic readable and testable
- **Inverting Conditional Logic** â€“ Flip conditions to reduce nesting

---

## ðŸ”¥ Error Handling

- **Types of Errors in JavaScript:**  
  `SyntaxError`, `ReferenceError`, `TypeError`

- **try / catch / finally** â€“ Catch and handle runtime issues
- **throwing Errors** â€“ Explicitly signal something went wrong
- **Error Guards** â€“ Prevent bad execution early
- **Extracting Validation Code** â€“ Cleanly separate input checks from main logic
